1: Basic Building Blocks

In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type
5 + 7 and press Enter

``` r
5+7
```

    [1] 12

To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x \<-
5 + 7. This can be read as ‘x gets 5 plus 7’. Give it a try now.

``` r
x <- 5 + 7
```

To view the contents of the variable x, just type x and press Enter. Try
it now.

``` r
x
```

    [1] 12

Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y.

``` r
y <- x - 3
```

What is the value of y? Type y to find out

``` r
y
```

    [1] 9

The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which
stands for ‘concatenate’ or ‘combine’. To create a vector containing the
numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the
result in a variable called z

``` r
z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
```

Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access
R’s built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want
more information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses
that normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

``` r
?c
```

Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating
the values in the output.

``` r
z
```

    [1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that
contains z, 555, then z again in that order. Don’t assign this vector to
a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

``` r
c(z, 555, z)
```

    [1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the
following to see what happens: z \* 2 + 100.

``` r
z * 2 + 100
```

    [1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called
my_sqrt.

``` r
my_sqrt <- sqrt(z - 1)
```

Print the contents of my_sqrt.

``` r
my_sqrt
```

    [1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z
divided by my_sqrt.

``` r
my_div <- z / my_sqrt
```

Go ahead and print the contents of my_div.

``` r
my_div
```

    [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

To see another example of how this vector ‘recycling’ works, try adding
c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don’t worry about saving the result in a new
variable.

``` r
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
```

    [1]  1 12  3 14

In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through
previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you
get to this command (z \* 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit
Enter. If the up arrow doesn’t work for you, just type the corrected
command.

``` r
z * 2 + 1000
```

    [1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

You can type the first two letters of the variable name, then hit the
Tab key (possibly more than once). Most programming environments will
provide a list of variables that you’ve created that begin with ‘my’.
This is called auto-completion and can be quite handy when you have many
variables in your workspace. Give it a try. (If auto-completion doesn’t
work for you, just type my_div and press Enter.)

``` r
my_div
```

    [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

2: Workspace and Files

Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working
directory using getwd().

``` r
getwd()
```

    [1] "C:/Users/Asus/Desktop/Универ/Захарчук/4 курс/lab_1/Lab_1"

List all the objects in your local workspace using ls()

``` r
ls()
```

    [1] "has_annotations" "my_div"          "my_sqrt"         "x"              
    [5] "y"               "z"              

Assign 9 to x using x \<- 9.

``` r
x <- 9
```

Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

``` r
ls()
```

    [1] "has_annotations" "my_div"          "my_sqrt"         "x"              
    [5] "y"               "z"              

List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or
dir().

``` r
dir()
```

    [1] "lab_1.md"        "lab_1.qmd"       "lab_1.rmarkdown" "mytest2.R"      
    [5] "mytest3.R"       "testdir"         "testdir2"       

As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page for
each new function. Check out the help page for list.files with the
command ?list.files.

``` r
?list.files
```

Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().

``` r
args(list.files)
```

    function (path = ".", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, full.names = FALSE, 
        recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, 
        no.. = FALSE) 
    NULL

Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called
“old.dir”.

``` r
old.dir <- getwd()
```

Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory
called “testdir”.

``` r
dir.create("testdir")
```

    Warning in dir.create("testdir"): 'testdir' уже существует

Set your working directory to “testdir” with the setwd() command.

``` r
setwd("testdir")
```

Create a file in your working directory called “mytest.R” using the
file.create() function.

``` r
file.create("mytest.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

This should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let’s
check this by listing all the files in the current directory.

``` r
list.files()
```

    [1] "lab_1.md"        "lab_1.qmd"       "lab_1.rmarkdown" "mytest.R"       
    [5] "mytest2.R"       "mytest3.R"       "testdir"         "testdir2"       

Check to see if “mytest.R” exists in the working directory using the
file.exists() function.

``` r
file.exists("mytest.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

Access information about the file “mytest.R” by using file.info().

``` r
file.info("mytest.R")
```

             size isdir mode               mtime               ctime
    mytest.R    0 FALSE  666 2023-10-05 10:13:38 2023-10-05 10:13:38
                           atime exe
    mytest.R 2023-10-05 10:13:38  no

Change the name of the file “mytest.R” to “mytest2.R” by using
file.rename().

``` r
file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

Make a copy of “mytest2.R” called “mytest3.R” using file.copy().

``` r
file.copy("mytest2.R", "mytest3.R")
```

    [1] FALSE

Provide the relative path to the file “mytest3.R” by using file.path().

``` r
file.path("mytest3.R")
```

    [1] "mytest3.R"

You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are
independent of the operating system your R code is running on. Pass
‘folder1’ and ‘folder2’ as arguments to file.path to make a
platform-independent pathname.

``` r
file.path("folder1", "folder2")
```

    [1] "folder1/folder2"

Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create
. Notice the ‘recursive’ argument. In order to create nested
directories, ‘recursive’ must be set to TRUE.

``` r
?dir.create
```

Create a directory in the current working directory called “testdir2”
and a subdirectory for it called “testdir3”, all in one command by using
dir.create() and file.path().

``` r
dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE)
```

    Warning in dir.create(file.path("testdir2", "testdir3"), recursive = TRUE):
    'testdir2\testdir3' уже существует

Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that
we created the variable old.dir with the full path for the orginal
working directory at the start of these questions.)

``` r
setwd(old.dir)
```

3: Sequences of Numbers

The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the
`:` operator. Type 1:20 to see how it works.

``` r
1:20
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could
also use it to create a sequence of real numbers. For example, try
pi:10.

``` r
pi:10
```

    [1] 3.141593 4.141593 5.141593 6.141593 7.141593 8.141593 9.141593

What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.

``` r
15:1
```

     [1] 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1

Pull up the documentation for `:` now.

``` r
? ':'
```

The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the `:`
operator. Try seq(1, 20) to see this.

``` r
seq(1, 20)
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let’s say that instead
we want a vector of numbers ranging from 0 to 10, incremented by 0.5.
seq(0, 10, by=0.5) does just that. Try it out.

``` r
seq(0, 10, by=0.5)
```

     [1]  0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5  4.0  4.5  5.0  5.5  6.0  6.5  7.0
    [16]  7.5  8.0  8.5  9.0  9.5 10.0

Or maybe we don’t care what the increment is and we just want a sequence
of 30 numbers between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length=30) does the trick.
Give it a shot now and store the result in a new variable called my_seq.

``` r
seq(5, 10, length=30)
```

     [1]  5.000000  5.172414  5.344828  5.517241  5.689655  5.862069  6.034483
     [8]  6.206897  6.379310  6.551724  6.724138  6.896552  7.068966  7.241379
    [15]  7.413793  7.586207  7.758621  7.931034  8.103448  8.275862  8.448276
    [22]  8.620690  8.793103  8.965517  9.137931  9.310345  9.482759  9.655172
    [29]  9.827586 10.000000

You’re using the same function here, but changing its arguments for
different results. Be sure to store the result in a new variable called
my_seq, like this: my_seq \<- seq(5, 10, length=30).

``` r
my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length=30)
```

To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function.
Try it now.

``` r
length(my_seq)
```

    [1] 30

There are several ways we could do this. One possibility is to combine
the `:` operator and the length() function like this: 1:length(my_seq).
Give that a try.

``` r
1:length(my_seq)
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
    [26] 26 27 28 29 30

Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try.

``` r
seq(along.with = my_seq)
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
    [26] 26 27 28 29 30

However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate
built-in function for this purpose called seq_along(). Type
seq_along(my_seq) to see it in action.

``` r
seq_along(my_seq)
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
    [26] 26 27 28 29 30

If we’re interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can
use rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.

``` r
rep(0, times = 40)
```

     [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    [39] 0 0

If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector
(0, 1, 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.

``` r
rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10)
```

     [1] 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2

Finally, let’s say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over
and over again, we want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10 ones,
then 10 twos. We can do this with the `each` argument. Try rep(c(0, 1,
2), each = 10).

``` r
rep(c(0, 1, 2), each = 10)
```

     [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

4: Vectors

First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5,
55, -10, and 6.

``` r
num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)
```

Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect \< 1,
which is read as ‘num_vect is less than 1’.

``` r
tf <- num_vect < 1
```

Print the contents of tf now.

``` r
tf
```

    [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

Let’s try another. Type num_vect \>= 6 without assigning the result to a
new variable.

``` r
num_vect >= 6
```

    [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

Create a character vector that contains the following words: “My”,
“name”, “is”. Remember to enclose each word in its own set of double
quotes, so that R knows they are character strings. Store the vector in
a variable called my_char.

``` r
my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")
```

Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.

``` r
my_char
```

    [1] "My"   "name" "is"  

Type paste(my_char, collapse = ” “) now. Make sure there’s a space
between the double quotes in the `collapse` argument. You’ll see why in
a second.

``` r
paste(my_char, collapse = " ")
```

    [1] "My name is"

To add (or ‘concatenate’) your name to the end of my_char, use the c()
function like this: c(my_char, “your_name_here”). Place your name in
double quotes where I’ve put “your_name_here”. Try it now, storing the
result in a new variable called my_name.

``` r
my_name <- c(my_char, "Vika")
```

Take a look at the contents of my_name.

``` r
my_name
```

    [1] "My"   "name" "is"   "Vika"

Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name
together into a single character string. Don’t forget to say collapse =
” “!

``` r
paste(my_name, collapse = " ")
```

    [1] "My name is Vika"

In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of
length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try paste(“Hello”, “world!”, sep = ” “),
where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined
elements with a single space.

``` r
paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")
```

    [1] "Hello world!"

For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each
of length 3. Use paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 with the
character vector c(“X”, “Y”, “Z”). This time, use sep = “” to leave no
space between the joined elements.

``` r
paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")
```

    [1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = “-”), where LETTERS is a
predefined variable in R containing a character vector of all 26 letters
in the English alphabet.

``` r
paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
```

     [1] "A-1" "B-2" "C-3" "D-4" "E-1" "F-2" "G-3" "H-4" "I-1" "J-2" "K-3" "L-4"
    [13] "M-1" "N-2" "O-3" "P-4" "Q-1" "R-2" "S-3" "T-4" "U-1" "V-2" "W-3" "X-4"
    [25] "Y-1" "Z-2"
